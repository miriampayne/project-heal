Milestone Portfolio Project 1 - HTML and CSS
Project Heal

CONTENTS

PURPOSE

The sole purpose of creating this website is completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer course. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML and CSS Essentials Modules.

The target audience for this product is users looking for self improvement. The main focus of the site is educating users, enabling them to understand Project Heal’s mission and allowing them to sign up to a newsletter for further guidance and latest news/events. Therefore this website is aimed at anyone who is looking to gain more insight into alternative/holistic healing and wishes to boost their mental and/or physical state, or indeed anyone looking to connect with like-minded individuals through local events. 

PRODUCT
Offering users the ability to sign up for free holistic healing advice that is issued via newsletter which combines information on popular mind and body techniques with traditional spiritual wisdom and any local news/events that might interest or assist in the user’s journey. The website also helps users to understand the 4 main categories that can:
- create a shift in consciousness
- increase concentration and mindfulness
- assist in reconnecting with nature
- promote optimum health and happiness

Local events hosted by external parties that users can attend are listed on Meetup or Eventbrite and shared via the Project Heal’s newsletter. Users can become a member by signing up to the Project Heal newsletter via the Contact Form on the Project Heal website. 

MISSION:
Project Heal mission is to facilitate living a healthy and happy lifestyle and spread awareness of the ever increasing demands of modern society which are causing more individuals than ever before to seek self-help for issues that may be harmful in the long run if left untreated but are all too often put on a waitlist for support. We want to enable more people to take immediate action on their own health before preventable illnesses become yet another global crisis that mankind must face.
