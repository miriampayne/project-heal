**PURPOSE**

The main focus of the site is educating users, enabling them to understand Project Heal&#39;s mission and allowing them to sign up to a newsletter for further guidance and latest news/events. Therefore this website is aimed at anyone who is looking to gain more insight into alternative/holistic healing and wishes to boost their mental and/or physical state, or indeed anyone looking to connect with like-minded individuals through local events.

**PRODUCT**

Offering users the ability to sign up for free holistic healing advice that is issued via newsletter which combines information on popular mind and body techniques with traditional spiritual wisdom and any local news/events that might interest or assist in the user journey. The website also helps users to understand the 4 main categories that can:

- create a shift in consciousness
- increase concentration and mindfulness
- assist in reconnecting with nature
- promote optimum health and happiness

Local events hosted by external parties that users can attend are listed on Meetup or Eventbrite and shared via the Project Heal&#39;s newsletter. Users can become a member by signing up to the Project Heal newsletter via the Contact Form on the Project Heal website.

**UX/UI User Experience Design**

All Pages contain a Navigation menu at the top of the Webpage that directs the user to a new Page to allow users to Navigate the site easily. The Nav Menu is repositioned on a Mobile device to make use of space on smaller devices.

The Fonts used in this project are called &quot;Quicksand&quot; and &quot;Teko&quot; from Google Fonts with a back-up font of &quot;sans-serif&quot;.

**Business Goals**

Project Heal mission is to facilitate living a healthy and happy lifestyle and spread awareness of the ever increasing demands of modern society which are causing more individuals than ever before to seek self-help for issues that may be harmful in the long run if left untreated but are all too often put on a waitlist for support. We want to enable more people to take immediate action on their own health before preventable illnesses become yet another global crisis that mankind must face.

**TESTING**

As per the following guidelines: [https://www.guru99.com/web-application-testing.html](https://www.guru99.com/web-application-testing.html) I tested for the following:

Functionality:

- Checking for Syntax Errors
- Readable Color Schemas
- Standard Compliance.

Tested in incognito mode to avoid extensions impacting performance

Usability

Compatability: Firefox vs Chrome

Performance

Crowd - tested on family and work colleagues

The site has been tested against various screen sizes for a mobile-first responsive design and web pages have been Styled accordingly though the Explore page requires further work on responsiveness.

Validator Testing

Once testing was complete and i was more or less happy with the result i used validators W3C validator for HTML and Jigsaw Validator for CSS.

https://validator.w3.org/



[https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)



All links to external websites open in a new browser tab. As this project is static and contains no back-end functionality at this time, the testing performed was on the visual effects and layout of the Website. Testing has been done on two main web browsers and all screen sizes down to 320px wide using the mobile simulator in Chrome Dev Tools.

All nav links direct to the correct html pages as per their names. The Home page is the exception, this one will redirect to index.html.

Use of the hover effect - all links show a difference in Color when you hover over the link.

Images are responsive on main page with their position changing in a visually pleasing manner, depending on breakpoints

Checked CSS Stylesheet correctly linkd to HTML but changing font-family

Tested color inheritence on body using color red for styling navigation menu items

Used Chrome Dev Tools to test various styles, especially for flex

**Validator Testing**

[https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)

Main Page did not see any errors:

![Main Page HTML Validation Response](assets/images/html-validator.png)

Whereas the Explore Page Requires some Fixes:

![Explore Page Validation Response](assets/images/explore-validation-issues.png)

![](RackMultipart20220222-4-1atd3m4_html_578aa91105f6a69b.png)

For CSS, I used the following Validator:

[https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

With no issues found like so:

**Lighthouse**

Tests were run on Lighthouse for both mobile and desktop with full marks apart from accessibility due to my contrast colours in the heading which I looked at fixing but decided in the end the visual presentation was better when the logo colour matches the nav bar colour.

![Lighthouse](assets/images/lighthouse.png)

![](RackMultipart20220222-4-1atd3m4_html_5ae3f80801f4fb90.png)

**DEVICES**

I used a simulator in Chrome Dev Tools

**Chrome Developer Tools &amp; Responsive**

![Chrome Dev Tools](assets/images/chrome-dev-tools.png)

![](RackMultipart20220222-4-1atd3m4_html_f62bcaa559e84717.png)

Chrome Dev Tools and Responsive Mode
Chrome Dev Tools played a huge role in my testing on a day to day basis, i was able to edit my css in real time to confirm the code im writing had to correct output as i was coding. It mostly helped when Styling for responsive mode.

Links
I tested all links across all pages to make sure they all redirect to the correct pages. I also made sure that for links leadng to external websites i used the target _blank attribute to open a new tab so the user does not lose place on our website.

Browsers
I Tested compatibility across browsers by using Safari, Chrome and iOS Safari. As an extra measure i also tested browser compatibilty across more browsers using the plugin User-Agent Switcher.

**ACCESSIBILITY**

Reaching 96% on Accessibility, I am keen to tinker around with colour contrast some more to meet 100% accessibility on Lighthouse. ARIA labels and alts were added to images.

**FIXED BUGS AND ERRORS**

Fixed hero image not loading issue with code from FreeCodeCamp: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript-and-bootstrap/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript-and-bootstrap/)

Zoom caused hero image to bleed over nav bar where overflow: hidden was not working due to some scoping, resolved with fixed height

Mitigated the issue of the foundations box containers not spacing correctly by using Chrome Dev Tools and checking which flex value works best.

![Flex Bug Solving](assets/images/flex.png)

![](RackMultipart20220222-4-1atd3m4_html_1e0102206ebd6068.png)

My Font awesome account had an older version kit v5, the current version is v6 so the links weren&#39;t working for my kit and you only get one free per account so I needed to use &quot;fab fa-social &quot; instead of &quot;fa-brands fa-social&quot; in my html i classes. In hind-sight, I could have just created a new free Font Awesome account with a dummy email address but it was good to figure out a work-around. I used the &quot;How to Build Footer Section&quot; of this FreeCodeCamp page: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript-and-bootstrap/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript-and-bootstrap/) to work out the difference in the links.

I later realised there&#39;s actually a drop-down filter that should be selected in the icon search field of the Font Awesome Website: [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/)

Changed active page underline border to sit closer to the anchor element by removing it from the li class .push and adding a .active class to the anchor element of the active page

Got nav menu to sit centre under logo with Flexbox / media queries

**UNRESOLVED BUGS OR ERRORS**

Responsiveness on Explore page

Nav looks a little off center on mobile device

Between 927 and 1200 need to fix spacing between items inside each top/bottom div maybe put some more divs inside those divs

Need media query at 1200 x 1080

CSS does not allow words in foundations box containers to centre-align

Had lots of issues trying to get the zig-zag effect on the Explore page so a lot of the issues remaining and many of the responsive issues is both a time and knowledge restriction as i am yet to learn javascript and more to add the features I would like, for example a hamburger menu for the nav bar on mobile devices.

I would have liked to have spent a bit more time on responsiveness but I have run out of time so will save fixing those issue for post deployment

**FUNCTIONALITY**



**PROGRAMS USED**

**DEPLOYMENT**

**Creating My Website**

To create this project I used the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template by clicking the button labelled 'Use this template' within Github.
Next i was directed to the 'create new repository from template page', choosing a repo name and finally created repository from template button.
The commands used for commits throughout the project:
‘git add . ’ - This command was used to add changes to files to the staging area before committing 
git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates”’ - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository. git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.

I used python3 -m http.server to view the live preview

**Git Hub Pages**

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (NOT at the top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. Click Save and the page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section. 

**Forking a repo**

Forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. - This is the definition from Github Docs.
1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.
2. On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.
3. Fork
4. This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.

**Cloning a repo**

1. Navigate to the Github Repository you want to clone.
2. Click the drop down menu labelled "Clone".
3. Either Download the ZIP file, unpackage locally and open with IDE (This route ends here) OR Copy Git URL from the HTTPS dialogue box.
4. Open your developement editor and open a terminal window in a directory of your choice.
5. Use the 'git clone' command in terminal followed by the copied git URL.
6. A clone of the project will be created locally on your local machine.
