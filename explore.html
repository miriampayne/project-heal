            <p>Our body requires movement so it can carry out all it's various functions. So we don't just mean you have to necessarily be doing loads of HIIT classes, though they are great for time management and can be rather fun, there are several other ways you can move that your body mind and sould will appreciate. Just step outdoors! Go hiking, climb a mountain, find a river, go wild swimming in the sea, it's all the rage! Any movement, even if it is just walking at a slow pace, in fact, especially if it is walking at a slow pace. Your body then has a chance to catch all that oxygen and quieten the mind. If you are ever feeling anxious, sad or drained, just pop yourself outside into nature, try hugging a tree and allow her vast amount of grounding energy to assist you. Start your day well with getting outdoors first thing. Exploring is great for not just the body but also the mind and the soul. As we discovered during these past years, you don't need to go to a gym to enjoy a workout, you'll find free workouts on our Instagram page that are super fun and you can take them at your own pace. It's all about a sustainable appraoch to looking after your health, it's important that we are gentle with ourselves.</p>

            <p><span>Nourish</span></p>
            <p>We can make a choice to eat foods of the seasons and to seek fresher, locally grown, or organic produce whose own cycles have not been tampered with by technology. There are many benfits to quitting or limiting sugar such as: an increased immune system, weight reduction, more stable moods, less bad bacteria in our gut, and improved sleep to name a few. Research has shown the gut acts as a second brain, directly affecting the health and stability of our immune system. There is an overwhelming number of new fad diets, books, apps, and social video content, but in general a good rule of thumb is everything in moderation. Even too much of a good thing can throw us off balance. Lemon, vitamin C, magnesium, yoghurt, probiotic supplements, all aid your body in recovery and a happy gut also helps to keep you better hydrated and vice-versa. What you put into your body can have a profound affect on your sleep cycle and mindfulness can help you better absorb nutrition as well as a good night's sleep so as you can see, it's all connected. Switching to a diet containing plenty of nutritious foods may serve to restore your vigor if you are ever feeling depleted.</p>

            <p><span>Rest</span></p>
            <p>There are studies that suggest a lack of sleep shortens the lifespan significantly. A short nap during the afternoon is common in many countries and can provide an energy boost and clearer senses. Lack of sleep, whether ongoing or the result of a single night's wakefulness, puts stress on the body and mind. It can negatively impact your physical and mental health. At one time, napping was considered a natural part of life. In the past hundred years, however, electricity and modern conveniences have provided us with more time to engage in personal and professional activities. Consequently there is now less time for sleep. A mere ten minutes of sleep in the middle of the day can leave you feeling more cheerful and alert. A half-hour long nap can sharpen your senses and refresh your energy reserves, and a shorter nap can even sustain you through a long day. Napping can help you make up for lost sleep and serves as a supplement to your usual sleep schedule. You may need to give yourself permission to nap by making naptime a part of your day. On top of that, our bodies are naturally encoded to respond to light and dark, sleeping with the rhthms of Mother Nature. Slowing down and listening to your own natural rhythm can quickly connect you to the Universe. We encourage you to try sleep measuring/assistance apps like Calm, breaks from technology, grounding/earthing for ions. We also recommend eating cherries as they release chemicals that assist in the sleep process and needless to say exercise will encourage a great night's sleep so be sure to keep all 4 Foundations in check.</p>
